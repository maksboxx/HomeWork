    <p><b>Peter</b> Pan is a fictional character created by <a href="">Scottish</a> novelist and playwright <a href="">J. M. Barrie</a>. A
        free-spirited
        and mischievous
        young
        boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of
        <a href="">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with <a href="">fairies</a>, <a
                href="">pirates</a>, <a href="">mermaids</a>,
        <a href="">Native
            Americans</a>, and
        occasionally ordinary
        children from the world outside Neverland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works
        by Barrie, <a href="">The
        Little White Bird</a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in <a href="">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a> in 1906), and the <a
            href="">West
        End stage</a> play
        <a href="">Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up </a>(1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel <a href="">Peter and
        Wendy</a>), the character
        has been
        featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films,
        television series and many other works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Barrie commissioned a statue of <a href="">Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight
        in <a href="">Kensington
        Gardens</a> on 30
        April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.<a href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Six other statues have been cast from the original
        mould and
        displayed
        around
        the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a href="">series of UK postage stamps</a> issued by the <a href="">Royal Mail</a> on
        the centenary of
        Barrie's
        creation of the character.<a href=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>

        <p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href="">The Little White Bird</a>(1902), a novel for adults. In chapters
            13–18, titled
            "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to <a href="">Kensington
                Gardens</a> in London,
            where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the
            character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his <a href="">stage play</a> titled <a href="">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who
                Wouldn't
                Grow Up</a>, which
            premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.<a href=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> Following
            the success of the 1904 play,
            Barrie's
            publishers, <a href="">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in
            1906 under the
            title <a href="">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens,</a> with the addition of illustrations by <a href="">Arthur Rackham</a>.<a
                    href=""><sup>[4
                ]</sup></a>
            Barrie later adapted and
            expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a novel, which was published in 1911 as <a href="">Peter and Wendy</a>.</p>
        <p>
            J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day
            before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<a href=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>
